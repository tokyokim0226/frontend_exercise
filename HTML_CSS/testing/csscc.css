/* systematic way to write css html 
1. How do I want to arrange these html elements on the epage? What do i want
    Never want to go into it without thinking about how you want it ton the page
2. How do I want to arrange those in the form of HTML
    - Need foresight as to how to use divs and some other semantic elements
3. How can I use CSS to achieve the layout I have imagined
4. How should each element be styled

--> once you got all the elements layed out on the page in the layout that
you deisre, styling becomes rather trivial --> it's simply small tweaks in the more
detailed graphics of the website
