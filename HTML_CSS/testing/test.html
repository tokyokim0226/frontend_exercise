<!-- Inline vs Inline-block
- Inline elements will simply make the elements fit inline. Changing the width/height of the elements
will not be reflected as the inline by default attempts to simply fit everything "in that line"

in contrast, inline-block elements are a hybrid of an inline and a block element - while they
will not start on a new line for every element as block elements do, they will make sure that
the properties (height/width) are maintained whilst still keeping the elements in-line (but only doing so when possible/when there is enough space in the viewport to do so)

<!-- Box sizing: border-box vs content-box
width, height - these decide the dimensions of the content within the box model (the actual content)
box model - content, padding, border, margin (margin is not included in the size)
1. content box - fixes the content box size to a designated width (basically the same as using width)
2. border box - width includes the padding and the border also

<!-- Box Model Review
1. The Box Model dsescribes how much "space" an HTML element occupies on a page
2. This "space" is adjusted/heavily influenced by the box-sizing property (whether it is content box or border box mentioned above)
3. The "space" and layout is heavily influenced by the display property (here we only looked at inline, inline-block, and block elements. Grid and flex to be learned later)
4. The most important components of the box model are height, width, padding, border, and margin
5. All other CSS properties are supplementary to this Box Model concept
