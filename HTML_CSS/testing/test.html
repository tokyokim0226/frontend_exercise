<!-- Inline vs Inline-block
- Inline elements will simply make the elements fit inline. Changing the width/height of the elements
will not be reflected as the inline by default attempts to simply fit everything "in that line"

in contrast, inline-block elements are a hybrid of an inline and a block element - while they
will not start on a new line for every element as block elements do, they will make sure that
the properties (height/width) are maintained whilst still keeping the elements in-line (but only doing so when possible/when there is enough space in the viewport to do so)
