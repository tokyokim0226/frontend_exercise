<!-- Definition of a semantic HTML
    -> A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.  
    building an HTML document with a bunch of div elements is not "semantic" - in other words, we are
    not really explaining what our doucment means to a developer who is looking at the raw source code.
    The HTML source code itself does not contain much meaning about how the document is oriented

    some tags that could make a document more "semantic" include:
    nav, section, main, article, footer, header, etc. - these give a general outline of the document

    It is also important to note that the idea with the newest HTML standard is that each HTML tag should
    represent the INTENT of the document, not the style. In general, you could possibly use tags such as <strong>
    and <em>> (italics), but these are not recommended as they are more to do with the style than the  meaning
    of the document.

<!-- Why should script tags be placed at the end of body tag?
    This is because when the browser encounters a <script> tag, it loads and executes the javascript code 
    immediately right there on the spot. If this tag is somewhere near the top of the document, the browser
    will ttempt to load and execute the javascript code first right there and there, which may result in a slow
    down of the loading of the page (the page rendering speed and thus the webpage will take more time to load)
    
    Simply put, it helps reduce the page loading time by allowing the rest of the page to load before
    loading the javascript files, which in many cases can be large -->
<script src="meme.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</body>

<!-- Can anything be placed after the closing body </body> tag?
only comments and the end tag for the html (</html>) are allowed after the end tag of the body
- it should be the second last element in the whole document -->
